Fourth challenge for the info343 course

Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc.)? If so, please list who.
Alex, Jordan Hand, Google


Did you complete any advanced extensions to this challenge? If so, what?
Nope. I was going to but stuff came up this week.


Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this challenge?
20.


Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better?

While I greatly appreciate how often you are available on Slack, as well as the general caliber of your helpful comments, I think having office hours sometime before the Monday's when the assignments are due would be great; you might even not need to be THAT active on Slack because people can ask better questions in pursue/ learn ways to debug for themselves? Maybe? If it's a hassle, obviously ignore this suggestion :D . (EDIT: Y'all already did but I'm leaving this here b/c you hadn't when I started on this assignment Last Wednesday).

Also, maybe we could have some general lectures on the logic of scripting languages? How scope works/ if there's reference/variable semantics, things like that. Professor Freeman
does an amazing job explaining how and what we do, perhaps having this (^) lecture could eliminate some of the more common concerns/basic concerns people have with coding.
