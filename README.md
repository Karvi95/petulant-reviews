Fourth challenge for the info343 course

Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc.)? If so, please list who.



Did you complete any advanced extensions to this challenge? If so, what?



Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this challenge?



Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better?

While I greatly appreciate how often you are available on Slack, as well as the general caliber of your helpful comments, I think having office hours sometime before the Monday's when the assignments are due would be great; you might even not need to be THAT active on Slack because people can ask better questions in pursue/ learn ways to debug for themselves? Maybe? If it's a hassle, obviously ignore this suggestion :D .
